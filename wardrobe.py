# We would like for you to design a wardrobe class, where you have a wardrobe that can store various clothing items. The wardrobe should have the ability to add new items manually, remove items manually, but also have the ability to remove all items that are a particular color (e.g. "red"), or remove all items that are a particular style (e.g. "shirt") . Finally the wardrobe should have a max capacity, which would prevent new items from being added if at max capacity already.

# Clothing items should come in different varieties (shirts, sweaters, pants, shorts, belts, etc...) and colors (blue, green, red, etc..).
